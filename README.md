# AI-chatboot
Our AI Chatbot project utilizes Python, Streamlit, and the Anthropics API to create an interactive conversational interface. Users can input text, triggering the chatbot to generate real-time responses powered by advanced AI models. With a streamlined user experience and versatile applications, our chatbot aims to revolutionize how users engage with technology, offering accessible information retrieval and fostering meaningful interactions. 

**Use Case: Educational AI Chatbot**

This script could be used to build an educational question and answer chatbot. Students could input their questions about various subjects, and the chatbot would generate informative answers based on those questions. For example, students could ask about historical events, scientific concepts, mathematical problems, or language translations, and the chatbot would provide relevant information or explanations. This could serve as a valuable learning tool, providing instant access to knowledge and aiding in comprehension.
